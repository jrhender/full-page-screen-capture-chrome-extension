Initial versions of model.py, task.py, util.py and requirements.txt were taken from the Google Census TF-Keras [Example] (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/census/tf-keras)

Note that to get past an SSL error when downloading model weights, had to use the advice in the Python ReadMe, which is to run /Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command
I was told to do this by this github issue https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/issues/46
